Vanderbilt was instructed to simply throw the scarves, one after the other, to the top corners of an imaginary box positioned over his head. He did, and the scarves fluttered to the floor. She wanted him to throw and then catch the scarves, once. He did easily, but it became overwhelming for him when he was asked to keep repeating the process.
​
Wolf didn’t want him to think of the catches; she explained that the key to learning juggling is not thinking. If he just kept throwing to the corners, his hands would move to where they needed to be for the catch.
​
Juggling isn't about tracking each object in flight, which beginners mostly try to do. In juggling, unlike most sports, you just have to look to the apex of where things are thrown, not the objects in flight.
​
A week’s juggling changed him as a person. A lot of studies have revealed that juggling alters the brain. This “activation-dependent structural brain plasticity,” as it’s been called, pops up in as little as a week.
​
When we learn to do something, the brain responds in a particularly charged way more than when we do something we’ve learned before.
