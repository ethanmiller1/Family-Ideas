# Ethan's #1 Tip: Take control

Conduct the interview as if you were the interviewer. I've conducted interviews before and I know that most interviewers aren't giving this interview as much thought as the interviewee. They can be nervous too. So break the ice, take control, and say something, "Hey Hamid, thanks for joining." Calm, cool, and high energy. You are totally relaxed. This is how I do my interviews and the technique always give me an edge over other candidates that sound nervous and awkward, or too enthusiastic and unnatural.

# Hamid

* Moved here from Chicago 4 years ago.
* Lives in McKinney.
* Had unlimited PTO, employees abused it, he only got 2 weeks.

Keep 4 to 6 good stories that have depth. Go for depth over quantity.

STAR storytelling technique:
1.  **Situation**: An event, project, or challenge faced.
2.  **Task**: Your responsibilities and assignments for the situation.
3.  **Action**: Steps or procedure taken to relieve or rectify situation.
4.  **Result**: Results of actions taken.

3 types of [compensation](https://www.levels.fyi/companies/amazon/salaries/software-engineer/levels/sde-ii?limit=50):
* Base Salary
* Stock Grant (/yr)
* Signing Bonus

Stock compensation:
-   End of year one – 5% of the initial grant ($30,000)
-   End of year two – 15% ($90,000)
-   Six months later – 20% ($120,00)
-   End of year three 20% ($120,000) for a total of $240,000 in year 3
-   Six months later – 20% ($120,000)
-   End of year four – 20% ($120,000) for a total of $240,000 in year 4
-   Your total stock vests = $600,000

25 days vacation, an extra 5 after 6 months.

# Final Interview Tips from [Saji](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAAmnKCU_hk&feature=youtu.be)

* Laptop, camera, and headsets are recommended.
* 4 rounds of interview (3 coding, 1 system design)

### Data structures

* Generic computer science fundamentals. Basic things.
* Are you able to work through data structures and algorithms?
* How well do you understand and apply data structures?
* Are you considering runtimes for common operations and understand how they use memory?

## Algorithms

* Divide and conquer
* When to use BFS vs. DFS.
* Are **you** discussing runtimes, theoretical limitations, basic implementations, strategies for different classes of algorithms.
* Before coding ask questions.
* Voice assumptions.
* Ask for examples.
* Ask them to validate their ideas.
* While coding explain decision making.
* Describe your code.
* Write syntactically correct code.
* Test the code or explain it.

### Problem Solving
### Logical
### Maintainable
### System Design

* Draw it out.
* Tradeoffs.
* Talk about advantages and disadvantages of your design.
* Operational performance.

#### What is the expectation for an L5?

* L5 will be owning software features within the team.
* Codes independently.
* Receives guidance on software design.
* Solving difficult software problems.

Most common leadership questionsg:
1.  Customer Obsession
2.  Ownership
3.  Invent and Simplify
4.  Are Right, A Lot
5.  Learn and Be Curious
6.  Insist on the Highest Standards
7.  Think Big
8.  Bias for Action
9.  Earn Trust
10.  Dive Deep
11.  Have Backbone; Disagree and Commit
12.  Deliver Results

Each round has 1 Technical Aspect and 2 Leadership Principle questions (7 minutes each).

Live code link and whiteboard link will be sent 48 hours prior to the interview. **Download everything ahead of time**.

* Keep a copy of your **resume** handy.
    
* Keep a **pen and paper** handy in case the whiteboard tool doesn't work.
    
* Keep a fully charged cell **phone** nearby.
    
* Keep a spare **headset** in case battery dies.
    
* Keep your **favorite drink** because you will be talking a lot.
    
* Stay in a **quiet place** where you won't be disturbed.
    
* Wear a **button down shirt**.
    
* Let them know if you need a bathroom break so you can be comfortable.

Within 5 business days of the interview, the interview team and the recruitment team has a conversation what was there experience with you on the interview date, and that is called debrief, and that's where they come to a result. The client lead will call to inform you of the results. He will not give feedback.

## Rule # 1: Ask clarifying questions.

This is the most important rule Saji emphasized, that she repeated over and over again.

Avoid awkward pauses and try to think out loud if possible. If you're not getting to an answer in 2 or 3 minutes, ask for help or a hint.

Mix success stories with failure stories. A lesson changes a failure into a success.

### You are the star

Say I, not we. It's awkward to talk about ourselves, but that is the expectation.

* Were you the key driver?
* What was your biggest contribution?
* What obstacles did you face?
* How did you overcome them?
* How did you influence the outcome?

### Keep eye contact during the introduction

### Speak clearly

I know you are good, so we don't have to worry about that. [17:53](https://youtu.be/rAAmnKCU_hk?t=1073)

The interviewers are listening, taking notes, and asking the follow-up questions all at the same time. They might miss certain things, so make sure things are done in a way that they don't miss anything.

### Data is crucial

Amazon is data-driven, so focus on quantitative or qualitative data in your stories.

* Numbers
* Money
* Process improved
* Time saved
* Tradeoffs
* What were the lessons?
* What would you do differently next time around?

## Problem Solving

* Ability to make a high level coding technical questions.
* How are you thinking through this?
* Identifying alternatives.
* Weighing different options.
* See potential roadblocks and challenges with your solutions.
* Run your initial thoughts.
* Gather requirements.
* Determine what is the most important piece of the problem.
* Are you able to translate them into clean code?
* Find edge cases.

They may give you a vague problem and see how you're approaching it.

The next step will be a Technical Phone Screen. Please find some information below to help you prepare for your Technical Phone Interview. Remember, this will be 1 hour in length (half technical, half behavioral and likely a live coding exercise). Please feel free to reach out to me at any time should you have any questions. I’m here to help!


**1. Technical/coding and design questions:**These questions will test your ability to solve a technical problem. If you are rusty, you should study up on:

- [ ]   Trees (binary/red black trees/N-ary trees, tree symmetric (inverse image), tree traversal, sorting trees)
    
	- [ ] Iterative Depth First Search
    
    - [ ] Recursive Depth First Search
    
    - [ ] Breadth First Search
    
- [ ]   hash maps, stacks/queues/heap/priority que
    
- [ ]   link lists/reverse link lists (space vs time)
    
- [ ]   recursion/recursive strings
     
	 - [ ] Base case
	 
- [ ]   binary search
    
- [ ]   Arrays - 2d/3d
    
- [ ]   graphs/graph traversal
    
- [ ]   Big O notation


**Some tools you might find useful to study up for the coding portion include:**

-   [https://leetcode.com/](https://leetcode.com/)
    
-   [https://www.hackerrank.com/](https://www.hackerrank.com/)
    
-   [https://www.amazon.com/Elements-Programming-Interviews-Insiders-Guide/dp/1479274836](https://www.amazon.com/Elements-Programming-Interviews-Insiders-Guide/dp/1479274836)
    
-   [https://www.amazon.com/Cracking-Coding-Interview-Programming-Questions/dp/098478280X](https://www.amazon.com/Cracking-Coding-Interview-Programming-Questions/dp/098478280X)
    
-   [https://aws.amazon.com/architecture/](https://aws.amazon.com/architecture/) – these are the tools that we use to develop amazon services/products.
    

**2. Behavioral questions using our [https://www.amazon.jobs/principles](https://www.amazon.jobs/principles)**

For the behavioral questions, you’ll want to read through the Leadership Principles to become familiar with them (you don’t need to memorize them). Have a few specific examples prepared that you can potentially use to address the questions. It’s good to think of examples regarding projects you’ve done at work, teams you’ve worked with, and products you’ve shipped/delivered (don’t share anything that is considered confidential).

**Here a few Overall Tips to be best prepared for the phone interview:**

-   Remember to ask clarifying questions—treat the interviewer as you would a customer. Do you have all the information needed to go ahead and solve the posed questions? Amazonians are customer obsessed so always work backwards from what the customer needs are.
    
-   Is there any assumptions that need to be confirmed? If so confirm them before moving forward, but also act when you have enough info.
    
-   They would love you to dive as deep as you can go. Remember to answer the question, and think out loud. In some cases you may have a live link to sketch out your answer but generally its by phone. Make sure you give the interviewer your full attention—don’t have interruptions or don’t type or search the internet for answers, be open and honest about what you know or don’t know and do your best. We want someone that can interface with customers honestly so it is an important part of the phone interview to listen and try to answer.
    
-   The screener will try and get a sense of your ability and scale of experience. This phone screen determines the level of your experience either an Ops Engineer II or Ops Engineer III, or could recommend another role.
    
-   Both roles are critical, so don’t worry, but I’ve put some of the key parts of the roles below so you can think about solving problems in the area of OS from Front end through to back, problem solving and including storage, network bottlenecks, scale, capacity management, compatibility, future loads….In other words Best Practice.
    
-   Anything on your resume is FAIR GAME for an interview. Please make sure you can speak to your experience on your resume.
