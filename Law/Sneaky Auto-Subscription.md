# Bait-and-Switch Advertising

Don't be fooled. As you will see in a moment, this is a bait-and switch.

> When sellers advertise a low price for an item generally unavailable to the consumer and then push the consumer to buy a more expensive item, they are engaging in **bait-and-switch advertising**. The low advertised price baits the consumer. Then the salesperson switches the consumer to a higher-priced item. In 1968, the FTC prohibited bait-and-switch advertising. ([Kubasek 539](https://www.businesslaw.org.ua/wp-content/DBL.pdf#page=572))

## Statute of Frauds

> The third is to prevent parties from entering into contracts with which they do not agree. The statute’s requirements impose on parties the need to consider the terms carefully, agree to them, write them down, and sign the contract. ([Kubasek 242](https://www.businesslaw.org.ua/wp-content/DBL.pdf#page=275))

## Checkout page

>I am sorry for the misunderstanding, Ethan. However, <mark class="hltr-yellow">when you place the order on our website there's a statement on the check out that discusses about the subscription</mark>. As much as I want to process the refund, I just couldn't since it's already beyond the moneyback guarantee. Here's what I'll do instead. I'll request one of my supervisors to review your account and check if we can still give considerations in processing the refund. An email will be sent to you within 24-48 hours as a confirmation for the return and refund policies. Thank you. ~ Ingrid

Notice there is no consent box to check that indicates you have Read and Agree to the terms of service. Why is there no consent box? Because they don't want you to know what you're signing up for. They are intentionally trying to hide from the customer that detail. That checkbox is required by the UCC. You simply go straight from "Add to Cart" to payment without any "Agree to Terms" pop up.

# Drafting And Filing Your Petition

**Since the petition is a formal court document, you need to draft it in a specific format and include the following:**

-   A succinct statement of the relevant facts of the case that support your claim, including <mark class="hltr-yellow">what the defendant did to harm you</mark>. Note that you do not need to present evidence at this stage—just assert the facts as you understand them.
-   <mark class="hltr-yellow">The principal of law violated</mark> (e.g. breach of contract, etc.) and its elements. 
-   What <mark class="hltr-yellow">relief</mark> you are seeking from the court (e.g. money damages, specific performance, etc.).
-   The <mark class="hltr-yellow">names and addresses of all the parties involved</mark>.  

At this point, you need to know in what court to file your petition. This is called the proper jurisdiction for suing a business. In general, you file your petition with the court in the same county as the principal office of the defendant. Finally, you will need to pay a filing fee to the court. While fees vary from county to county, generally expect to pay approximately $200 in filing fees.

# Statement of resolution

I am prepared to pay the $200 filing fee to file a petition against Smileactives to put a stop to the hundreds of people you are defrauding with these illegal business practices. I've already identified the principal of law violated and compiled screenshot evidence of the bait-and-switch shopping experience from your product page to your checkout page. The courts are sure to rule in my favor as this is a textbook example of said principal of law. I will sue for an amount of $2 million.

I will allow you to remediate the issue with 2 actions:
1. I receive a full refund of the money that was fraudulently laundered from me.
2. You will have 90 days to remove the auto-subscription from your website.

If I receive a refund but within 90 days the auto-subscription still remains, I will still file the petition against you with the proper court. This is not a joke to me, and it is not a joke to the hundreds of people you are ripping off. This isn't India, it's America, and I'm committed to keeping American businesses honest. And if that means taking a personal hit to shut down a dishonest business like yours, I am more than willing and able to spend the effort. But first I will offer this simple path of repentance. If you are an honest business you will have no problem listening to the 74 1-star reviews left to you by your customers on the [Better Business Bureau](https://www.bbb.org/us/ca/el-segundo/profile/dental-equipment/smileactives-1216-881921/customer-reviews). This is clearly a negative user experience. If you do not implement the features requested by your customers, I can only conclude that you are purposefully misleading them. (We'll find out what the judge concludes.) The choice is yours; choose wisely. Nobody gets away with anything in this world. You can trust me on that.

If 74 out of 74 reviews state they were not aware of the hidden "opt-in" clause, that will be hard for a judge to establish as "clear communication" (the second element of a binding contract).

## Review Moderated

I tried to leave a review on your site, but my review was taken out by an internal process.
