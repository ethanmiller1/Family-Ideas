## Contactless single & one day travel fares 2023

The majority of Londoners now simply use their contactless debit/credit cards rather than an Oyster card - and you can, too!

For central London (zone 1) it costs **£2.50** per journey with a contactless debit or credit card.

If you want to use your contactless card to pay for travel for the whole day, there’s a ‘daily cap’. This is the maximum you pay for unlimited travel in one day. For central London, it’s **£7.40**.
