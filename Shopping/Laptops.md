Laptops should have the following capabilities:
- [ ] Connect to 4 external monitors through a single docking station (requires Thunderbolt port).
- [ ] Charging and docking occurs through single Thunderbolt port.
- [ ] Lightweight, easy to hold with one hand ([Surface Pro](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/d/surface-laptop-4/946627FB12T1/1RBQ) is really good here).
- [ ] Bluetooth 5.0.
- [ ] 2 USB-A ports.
- [ ] 2 slots for memory (to upgrade to 32GB).

### What is alt mode?

Alt Mode is <mark class="hltr-yellow">a functional extension of USB-C which enables the USB connection to carry non-USB signals</mark>. Alt Mode(s) are optional capabilities that are unique to the USB-C connector or port that allow technologies, like DisplayPort and Thunderbolt 3, to be transmitted. If a port says that it is a **Basic** USB, that means it only supports USB signals.
