Laptops should have the following capabilities:
- [ ] Connect to 4 external monitors through a single docking station (requires Thunderbolt port).
- [ ] Charging and docking occurs through single Thunderbolt port.
- [ ] Lightweight, easy to hold with one hand ([Surface Pro](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/d/surface-laptop-4/946627FB12T1/1RBQ) is really good here).
- [ ] Bluetooth 5.0.
- [ ] 2 USB-A ports.
